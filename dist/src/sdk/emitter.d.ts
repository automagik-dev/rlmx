/**
 * Event emitter with async-iterator contract — Wish B Group 1 skeleton.
 *
 * The SDK's async iterator yields `AgentEvent`s as the agent runs. The
 * emitter is a thin broker: producers call `emit()` at state boundaries;
 * consumers iterate via `for await`. Multiple consumers may subscribe
 * to the same emitter — each receives every event.
 *
 * This file ships the contract shape only. Hooking the emitter into
 * `rlm.ts` + exposing `runAgent()` lands in Group 2-3 per WISH.md.
