/**
 * `runAgent()` — Wish B Group 2b.
 *
 * Ties the Group 1 event stream and the Group 2 primitives (session,
 * permissions, validate) into a single driving loop. The actual LLM /
 * REPL iteration is supplied by the caller via an `IterationDriver`
 * async generator — this keeps the wiring logic hermetic and
 * testable without needing a live model. When `runAgent` eventually
 * becomes the CLI entry, `rlm.ts` will be adapted into one of these
 * drivers; nothing in this file needs to change for that cutover.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *
 *   emit  AgentStart
 *   (if sessionStore)
 *     try resumeAgent → emit SessionOpen{resumed}
 *   loop iteration:
 *     emit IterationStart
 *     consume driver's steps:
 *       "message"     → emit Message; append history
 *       "tool_call"   → permission chain → emit ToolCallBefore/After
 *                       (deny ⇒ emit Error{phase:"tool-denied"})
 *       "emit_done"   → validate if schema supplied:
 *                         pass   → emit Validation{pass} + EmitDone; complete
 *                         fail@1 → emit Validation{fail,1}; loop with hint
 *                         fail@2 → emit Validation{fail,2} + Error; abort
 *                       no schema ⇒ emit EmitDone; complete
 *       "error"       → emit Error; abort
 *     emit IterationOutput (iteration summary)
 *     checkpoint via sessionStore.save
 *   emit SessionClose{reason}
 *   close emitter
 *
 * Spec: `.genie/wishes/rlmx-sdk-upgrade/WISH.md` L110-158.
