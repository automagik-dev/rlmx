/**
 * Cross-context `prepare` hook (revised 2026-04-22).
 *
 * npm / bun runs `prepare` in two very different situations:
 *
 *   1. **Local development checkout** — `npm install` inside rlmx's own
 *      repo. husky is present as a devDependency; we want it to set up
 *      git hooks. The build step should also run so dist/ stays in
 *      sync with src/ for committers.
 *
 *   2. **Git-URL consumer install** — e.g.
 *      `bun add git+https://github.com/automagik-dev/rlmx#<sha>`.
 *      The consumer's package manager may or may not run prepare
 *      (bun blocks trusted scripts by default), and devDependencies
 *      that `tsc` needs (like `@types/js-yaml`) may not be installed
 *      before prepare fires.
 *
 * New strategy: `dist/` is now committed to the git repo (see
 * `.gitignore` note). So consumer installs get a working dist
 * regardless of whether prepare fires. prepare's job becomes:
 *
 *   • husky setup when present (dev-only)
 *   • best-effort build — attempt, but DO NOT fail the install if
 *     build can't run (missing devDeps in consumer flows, husky
 *     untrusted-script block, etc.). The committed dist/ is the
 *     authoritative artifact consumers import; a failed local build
 *     doesn't stop them from using rlmx.
 *
 * When the committer forgets to run `npm run build` before
 * committing src/ changes, CI catches it via the `check` script plus
 * the test suite (which executes `dist/tests/*.test.js`). So the
 * prepare hook being tolerant of build failures in consumer contexts
 * does not create a silent staleness hazard for the canonical repo
 * tree.
